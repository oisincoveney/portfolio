He can take a task that has been broken down, and find a way to get it completed by all means necessary. In Oisin’s short time at his internship, he showed his technical ability and his growth potential to become a great engineer. I’m confident that Oisin will take the skills he’s learned at GoLinks and be able to apply them in his career. We’re excited to bring him back when he finishes up with his Masters!"
